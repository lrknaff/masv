##Reflection
This was a 3 week long personal project at the Turing School of Software and Design. My main goals were to work with a real company and focus on clean ui and animation techniques. I was really interested in familiarizing myself with parralax scrolling techniques and including complex animation and scrolling JavaScript plugins.

I chose to not include a JavaScript framework, like React, because I wanted to see if I could build a website to production without it, as I know that I may be working in a lot of codebases that don't utilize Frameworks like React or Ember.

One of the main challenges I ran into was not having access to routing without building my own backend server. In order to solve this problem I implemented a backend node server with Express.js and combined that with the powers of having multiple inputs and outputs with Webpack. It was also difficult to implement plugins into Webpack, it took a lot of research and trial and error to be able to write my Webpack in a way that allowed for ScrollMagic and GSAP.

This project really opened up a pandoras box for me with client side animations, I feel as though I've just dipped a toe in and I'm excited to be able to continue to learn more as this project progresses and to implement the techniques I learned into future projects.
